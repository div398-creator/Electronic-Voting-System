# Electronic Voting System

## Overview
The Electronic Voting System is a basic Java application that allows a group of individuals to cast votes for candidates while ensuring the integrity and anonymity of the voting process. This project is designed to be simple yet secure, preventing any tampering or fraud while ensuring that each voter can only vote once.

## Features
- **Voter Registration**: Each voter is assigned a unique ID, ensuring that votes are cast only by registered voters.
- **Secure Voting**: Votes are stored securely, with mechanisms in place to prevent double voting.
- **Vote Tallying**: Votes are counted, and results are displayed, ensuring transparency in the voting process.
- **Anonymity**: Voter identity is kept anonymous; only their unique ID and chosen candidate are stored.

## Goals
- **Privacy**: The system ensures that voters cannot know any information about the votes other than their own.
- **Security**: The system is designed to prevent any tampering with the votes.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for editing and running Java code.
